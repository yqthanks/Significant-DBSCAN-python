# Significant DBSCAN (Python version)
(This is the new **Python** version for data with arbitrary dimensions; previous [matlab version](https://github.com/yqthanks/Significant-DBSCAN-matlab) is optimized for 2D spatial data)

**Sharing code to support reproducible research.**

## Description
This work aims to address a major limitation of traditional density-based clustering approach -- the lack of statistical rigor. This makes approaches such as DBSCAN tend to return many spurious clusters. For example, according to the [HDBSCAN](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37456-2_14) paper: 
>"small clusters of objects that may be highly similar to each other just by chance, that is, as a consequence of the natural randomness associated with the use of a finite data sample"

The code implements significant DBSCAN to automatically remove spurious clusters through point-process based statistical tests.

Significant DBSCAN works particularly well when data has high volume of noise.

## Example
The following figure shows an example of results comparing DBSCAN and significant DBSCAN.

## Usage
[demo.py](https://github.com/yqthanks/Significant-DBSCAN-python/blob/main/demo.py) includes a demo on how to run Significant DBSCAN.

[SignificantDBSCAN_share.ipynb](https://github.com/yqthanks/Significant-DBSCAN-python/blob/main/SignificantDBSCAN_share.ipynb) has everything together in one notebook.

## Data
Example datasets are given in the sample_data/demo folder.

More datasets and scripts for synthetic data generation are provided in the eariler [matlab-version's repo](https://github.com/yqthanks/Significant-DBSCAN-matlab/tree/master/synthetic_data)

## Example comparison with other clustering techniques

In the following, the first figure shows results on complete random data where there is no true cluster, and any cluster detected is spurious (happen only due to natural randomness). In contrast, the second figure shows detections on truly clustered data (governed by clustered point process; please see [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340964.3340968) for more details).

**Complete random data (no true cluster exists)**

**Clustered data with noise in background (four shapes are true clusters; background are noises generated with homogeneous probability density)**
